// A named storage for data is a Variable
//for eg
// let message = "Hello message";
// console.log(message);

// Let used in js to create variables
// console.log(mesage);
// let mesage = "error"; //gives error as message accessed before initialisation

// we may also use "var" keyword , but its older and not used now, basically still exits due to legacy issues

// console.log(msg);
// var msg = "HELLO";  //here shows undefined as the var is hoisted to the top of the scope , here global scope and hence msg is declared but not initialised

// VAR vs LET
// var is function-scoped and hoisted to the top of function declaration
// let is block-scoped and hoisted to the top of the innermost block

// we will discuss more on these two 

// we also have another keyword - CONST , used when we dont want the value to be changed
// const a = 10;
// a = 20;
// console.log(a); TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
 //const generally used for dates etc

 // BE SENSIBLE WHILE NAMING A VARIABLE!!!
//  a variable name should not start with a number 
// it should be camel case and name should be meaningful
